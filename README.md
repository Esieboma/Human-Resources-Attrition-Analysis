Findings

2. The attrition rate for female (34.2%) was higher than that of male (27.0%), a deeper look into the salary indicates the male employees earn more than female employees in the same job role. This may be the cause of the higher attrition rate among the female employees.

3. The attrition for the specialist was higher than any other job role, which may be due to a non competitive salary    or lack of job satisfaction due to one reason or the other.
4. Generally, there is poor staff performance, which means that most employee find it hard to meet up with their targets
5. The demography that was most affacted is between Age 31-34, which may just be due to natural vibrancy of youth.
